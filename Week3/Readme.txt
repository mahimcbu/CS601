Hi Josh,
This week I created a webpage that uses javascript to do some basic operations.
I created the html page that links the script.js at the end of part of body. 
It starts of with a pop up welcome message then promts the user for a first name before popping another window to 
welcome the visitor by name. It then asks for two numbers in two different prompts and then prints out the addition value.
I used a function to perform the addition and another one to check for the total value against the number 10.
Then we entered a while loop where based on the prompt respose of yes/no we do the same addion function or say bye to the user.
