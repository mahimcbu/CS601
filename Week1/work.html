                <h1>A breif description of my previous work experiences</h1>
                <p> I started as a lab technician at Stony brook during my Sophmore year and then acquired an
                    engineering internship with a local engineering company named Air Techniques. After graduation,
                    I moved to St.Louis to work as a firmaware engineer at Boeing. The facility mainly produces Defense 
                    products. During pandemic, I switced job to move to eas coast. I joined Lockheed martin at
                    in their NJ facilty. I have been happily employed at this company ever since. To make it easier,
                    here is the history in a table format,

                <p>Almost all the works done at Lockheed martin's NJ facility are classified works. We primaryly make solid state radars
                    for both US and our allies. There are some space fense related works as well. Our work involves technical excellence, customer
                    relationship, and traveling to various product sites.
