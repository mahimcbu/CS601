Hi Josh, For week1, I have developed a biograhy website of me. I created 6 tabs to begin with and I made sure the htmls are validated throught the W3 validator link provided in the assignment1 document. I made sure to follow the following rules:

1. html5 semantics only  and no styling. 
2. At least one picture in each of the pages.
3. External and internal links
4. Audio player(mp3)
5. lists and tables in 1 or multiple pages.

In the Hobbies page, I went above and beyond by including a live google map that has my visited locations marked. I think it is unique feature to inlcude in a website
and give the audience something interesting to read/view.

I don't have a software development background and this is new to me. I tried my best to make the website as filling as possible but hope to learn more advanced features
in the following weeks.
