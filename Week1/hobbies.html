                <h1>What do I like to do when I travel?</h1><hr>
                <p>
                    I like to travel with friends and family. Travelling is boring if you don't have any accompany. I travelled with multiple friends in my college life.
                    We enjoyed the time of commuting to our destination. Every stop on the road is an experience as you get to see different cultures across the states.
                    I enjoy the food and usually taste the unique foods wherever I travel. I plan to continue to do the same with my lovely wife in the coming days. She is 
                    also a big fan of travelling.
