                    <h1>A brief introduction to me</h1>
                    <article>
                        I was born in Bangladesh in the year of 1995. I grew up closely with my only brother and was into sports from the childhood.
                        In 2011, after finishing my highschool, I moved to USA with my family. We struggled as an immigrant family at the beginning. My family supported 
                        me throughout the years when I was doing my undergrad from Stony Brook university in New york. I made my family proud by successfully completeing my
                        undergrad as an electrical engineer. My profession is Engineering. I am currently based in Philadelphia with my family and my lovely wife. Software development got me curious lately and
                        therfore I decided to start my masters degree in Software development with Boston University in 2022.
