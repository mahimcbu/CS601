                <article>
                    I was born in Bangladesh in the year of 1995. I grew up closely with my only brother and was into sports from the childhood.
                    In 2011, after finishing my highschool, I moved to USA with my family. We struggled as an immigrant family at the beginning. My family supported 
                    me throughout the years when I was doing my undergrad from Stony Brook university in New york. I made my family proud by successfully completeing my
                    undergrad as an electrical engineer. My profession is Engineering. I am currently based in Philadelphia with my family and my lovely wife. Software development got me curious lately and
                    therfore I decided to start my masters degree in Software development with Boston University in 2022.

                    I like watching soccer games and a little bit of American football. In soccer I support the English premier league club Liverpool. 
                    They are one of the top soccer clubs in England with a rich history. You can find more information about the club <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/">here</a>.
                    You can listen to the club anthem in the youtube video provided below. It gives me goosbumps. I became a fan of Philadelphia Eagles in the recent years of my residency in Philadelphia. Besides sports, I like traveling and eating variety of foods. I did a lot of traveling with my friends
                    in my college life. Traveling with my family and wife is one of my important future goals. I would also like to visit Liverpool football club and meet some of 
                    the players. As for professional goals, I would like to diversify my field of knowledge in the tech industry and continue to pursue learning new
                    skills.
