            <article>
            I was born in Bangladesh in the year of 1995. I greq up closely with my only brother and was into sports from the childhood.
            I finished my highschool and move to USA in 2011 with my family. We struggled as an immigrant family at the beginning. My family supported 
            me throughout the years when I was doing my undergrad from Stony Brook university in New york. I made my family proud by successfully completeing my
            undergrad as an electrical engineer. I am currently based in Philadelphia with my family and my lovely wife. Softwared development got me curious lately and
            therfore I decided to start my masters degree in Software development with Boston University in 2022.

                I like watching soccer games and a little bit of American football. In soccer I support the English premier league club Liverpool. 
                They are one of the top soccer clubs in England with a rich history. You can find more information about the club <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/">here</a>.
                You can listen to the club anthem in the youtube video provided below. It gives me goosbumps. I became a fan of Philadelphia Eagles in the recent years of my residency in Philadelphia. Besides sports, I like traveling and eating variety of foods. I did a lot of traveling with my friends
                in my college life. Traveling with my family and wife is my future goal. I also would like to visit Liverpool football club and meet some of 
                the players. As for professional goals, I would like to diversify my field of knowledge in the tech industry. continue to pursue learning New
                skills and improve the existing skills.
