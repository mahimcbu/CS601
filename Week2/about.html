                    <h1>A brief introduction to me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Sylhet, Bangladesh. I was interested in sports from a young age and grew quite close to my only sibling. I migrated to the USA in 2012 with my family
                        after completing high school. As an immigrant family, we initially faced difficulties. I received constant support from my family as I finished my undergraduate
                        degree at Stony Brook University in New York. By successfully completing my undergraduate studies as an electrical engineer, I made my family proud.
                        At the moment, engineering is my line of work. With my family and my gorgeous wife, I'm currently based in Philadelphia. Recently, I've become intrigued about 
                        software development, therefore I've made the decision to begin my master's program in software development at Boston University in 2022.
