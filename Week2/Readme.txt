Hi Josh, For week2 iteration, I have styled the html based biography website created during the week1 iteration.
I have validated both HTML and CSS codes using the validator link provided in the assignment document. 
I have styled all the important elements using css and made sure all of them use more than one property value as part of going above and beyond. 
You might notice the css style.css link has codes for three different screen sizes. I used media-query to break down screen sizes by pixels and then applied different characteristics to 
Make it easy to understand the differences in the page layout. Additionally, added some text animation after doing some research. I struggled with css grid layout. It would have been nice to get some more 
Exposure to grids, flex box, etc. I understand it's a research-based school but for CS601, the requirement should have said it's for those who have a web development background. I think people with prior knowledge will develop their websites with more advanced css styling which may not be true for a beginner.
